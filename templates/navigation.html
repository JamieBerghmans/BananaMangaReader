<h1>Navigating through BMR</h1>
<div style="height:auto;width:100%;border:1px solid #ccc;font:16px/26px Georgia, Garamond, Serif;">
<p>
This page describes the various screens or pages you will come across while using the BMR app and how to navigate across them by using the menu.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Home Page</h3>
The app opens in the Home page, which lets you access other pages of interest from the hamburger menu (three lines) in the top left corner of the screen.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Search Page</h3>
Clicking on Search Manga in the menu, takes you to the "search page" where you can search for a manga using the form. You will only get the top 20 results, so make sure you use some good key words.<br>
The results of the search will be displayed in a new page. You can click on a manga title to view more details, or make a new search here.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Manga Home Page</h3>
Clicking on a manga title from the search results takes you to the "Manga Home" or the manga title page. Here you can see more details about the manga and scroll through the list of available chapters.
From this page, using the menu option, you can add this manga to your favorites list.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Online Reader</h3>
Clicking on a chapter title from the Manga Home takes you to the "Online Reader". Here you can actually read the manga chapter.
Note that clciking on the left side of the page takes you to the next page. Clicking on the right will take you to the previous page.
The menu opens by clicking in the center of the screen. You can go back to the Manga Home, go to the next or previous chapter or select other options from the menu. More details below.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Favorites Page</h3>
From any page, clicking on "Favorites" in the menu takes you to the "Favorites" page, where you can see a list of the manga titles you have added. 
Clicking on these titles takes you to the "Manga Home" for that title. If you click on the "Remove" button, you can delete the title from your favorites.
You can expand your favorites list by using "Add to favorites" from the menu when on the "Manga Home" page.
Alternatively, you can manually add manga titles to your favorites. To do this, plug your device to a computer and navigate to .BMR/static and open the mangafavs.csv file.
This file should contain the manga title in the first column and a url to the manga title page from mangakakalot.com or manganato.com
</p>
<p>
<h3>Library Home Page</h3>
From any page, clicking on "Library" in the menu takes you to the "Library Home" page, where you can see a list of the manga titles whose chapters you have downloaded. 
You can manually add manga to your Library by making a new folder for your manga title under the "library" folder in ".BMR/static" after connecting your Kobo to your computer.
Make sure the folder structure looks like this: manga_title >> chapter_title >> (inside the chapter title you should have images with file names in ascending order)
Also make sure that none of these characters are in the manga_title: '.', '(space)', '"', '?', '>', '<', '/' , '|', '\', '*', ':', '\0' Instead use underscores '_'
</p>
<p>
<h3>Library Manga Home</h3>
Clicking on a title from the library home takes you to the "Libray Manga Home" for that title. Here, you can view a list of the chapters you have downloaded for this particular manga.
Click on a chapter title to read that chapter in the "Offline Reader"
</p>
<p>
<h3>Offline Reader</h3>
The "Offline Reader" functions the same as the online reader described above. The only difference is in the menu options, described below.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Navigation</h3>
From any page, you can click "Navigation" from the menu to open this page.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<h3>Shut down</h3>
From any page, you can click "Close app" from the menu to initiate app shut down. You should always do this before closing the browser. This stops the internal server from using CPU resources to serve pages on the localhost.
</p>
<p>
