# BananaMangaReader
Banana Manga Reader, also referred to as BMR, is an application designed to read manga on Kobo eReaders, which do not have an inbuilt manga reader for reading manga from online sources. It was designed to be easy to install and use. This also means that there isn't much that a user can configure without modifications to the code. However, Banana Manga Reader (BMR) provides most of the features you would want from a manga reader. You can read online, save a title to a favorites list and download chapters to your library for offline reading. The app was made more for reading manga you already know about rather than for discovering new manga, which is why the search capabilities are limited. (*cough, cough* this is totally by design, yeah.. *cough* not because I have limited knowledge about webscraping in python)

The app was built entirely with python for the back end, since this is the only language that I had any experience with. This meant that the ways I could interact with the device were limited. So, I relied on html for the front end, to provide buttons and images for navigating and viewing. That means that if you are interested, you can experiment with the html files and the python code to customize your BMR app! Even better would be using a similar framework to make more interesting applications for the Kobo ereaders. I will be very interested in seeing what the Kobo community can do with it.
